## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Efficiency:
In pursuit of optimizing our data workflow, I‚Äôve developed a personalized Python library, `sabagclass.py`, which houses a suite of custom classes designed to accelerate coding within our company. This library simplifies tasks such as database connections, data uploads, and automated reporting, enabling our team to focus on delivering insights rather than boilerplate code.
  ### üìö Library Highlights:
  - **`SqlUpload` Classes**: Simplify the process of uploading dataframes to different SQL databases, including SQL Server, AWS Redshift, and others, with optimal performance tweaks.
  - **`SqlConn` Classes**: Streamline database connection handling for multiple environments, ensuring secure and reliable access.
  - **`CheckIfRun`**: Monitor and verify the successful execution of scripts within our data pipelines, crucial for maintaining data integrity and uptime.
  - **`SqlUtils`**: Aggregate common SQL operations into utility functions, minimizing code duplication and potential errors across projects.
