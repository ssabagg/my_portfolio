# Omar Sabag's Data Science Portfolio

##  :bust_in_silhouette: About Me

Hello! I'm Omar, a Business Intelligence Manager at TE Connectivity. Holding a Master's degree in Data Science, I specialize in Python, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning, ETL, web scraping, and building Streamlit web apps. My passion is in turning complex datasets into actionable insights and leveraging my technical expertise to drive data-driven decisions.

Feel free to connect with me on [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-%230077B5.svg?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://linkedin.com/in/omarsabag) 

## Python and Data Science

As a Python Data Science Developer, I extensively use data manipulation, analysis, and visualization libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. I have a track record of crafting predictive models and insightful analytics for strategic decision-making, underpinned by a solid grasp of machine learning algorithms and data structures.

## Projects

   ### :snake: Personalized API Library ([`Personalized_library/`](https://github.com/ssabagg/my_portfolio/tree/main/Personalized_library))
   Created `sabagclass.py`, a suite of Python classes that act as a custom tool for enhancing database operations, ETL processes, and reporting automation. 

   ### :gear: Data ETL Workflows ([`ETL_SAP/`](https://github.com/ssabagg/my_portfolio/tree/main/ETL_SAP))
   Implemented data extraction from SAP and developed workflows for transforming and integrating data into SQL databases for in-depth analysis.

   ### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Machine Learning Demand Forecasting System ([`Machine_learning/`](https://github.com/ssabagg/my_portfolio/tree/main/Machine_learning))
   Developed a machine learning forecasting model using Scikit-Learn to enhance the accuracy of future demand predictions.

   ### :bar_chart: Web Applications ([`Streamlit_webapps/`](https://github.com/ssabagg/my_portfolio/tree/main/Streamlit_webapps))
   Utilized the Streamlit Library to create interactive web applications for data exploration, entirely built with Python.

   ### :envelope_with_arrow: Automated Reporting ([`automated_reporting/`](https://github.com/ssabagg/my_portfolio/tree/main/automated_reporting))
   Engineered automated email reporting scripts to disseminate timely data insights, incorporating Plotly charts within the email body.

   ### :spider_web: Web Data Extraction ([`web_scrapping/`](https://github.com/ssabagg/my_portfolio/tree/main/web_scrapping))
   Employed Selenium for automating web data extraction processes, streamlining the gathering of web-based information.
